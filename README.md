# GitEnvironment
My personal Git setup for Windows (Git aliases, Bash shell aliases and so on)

##
Starting from here, consider <home> as your user folder (C:\Users\<username>)

##How to use
Copy/merge these files in <home> folder:
* .bash_profile
* .bashrc
* .gitattributes
* .gitconfig
* .gitexcludes

##MinTTY
MinTTY saves its configuration into <home>\.minttyrc file
Then it saves other stuff into <home>\.mintty\ folder;
For istance, themes are in <home>\.mintty\themes.

Copy there the content of the user folder in this repo
to use these MinTTY configurations.
